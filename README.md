# **Microplastics Database** #


This project provides a platform for young people to participate in environmental management by cataloging plastic waste in the coastal environment.

The **microplastics database** allows students to store location and observations made out in the field.

The project features a dynamic React frontend web application. Users can regsiter to use the application via a secure signin procedure. The application allows users to enter field observations into a PostGIS geospatial database via interactive forms.  

Results from the database are surfaced to show progress, and highlight areas that have already been visited to prompt exploration of area which have not yet been surveyed.
